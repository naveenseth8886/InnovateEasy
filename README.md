InnovateEasy: AI Solutions Explorer for Businesses
Live Demo: https://innovateeasy.onrender.com
Overview
InnovateEasy is a multi-agent AI system designed to help businesses explore AI-driven solutions. It researches a specified company, generates tailored AI use cases, and suggests relevant datasets and tools for implementation. Built with Python, Streamlit, and Groq, the app leverages DuckDuckGo for real-time data and presents results in a user-friendly, markdown-formatted interface.
This project showcases skills in backend development (multi-agent AI logic), frontend development (Streamlit UI), and cloud deployment (GitHub and Render). It demonstrates an end-to-end workflow, from data processing to production deployment.
Features

Company Research: Analyzes a company’s industry, products/services, and strategic focus using AI and web search.
AI Use Cases: Generates 3-5 relevant AI use cases aligned with the company’s goals.
Resource Suggestions: Recommends datasets, models, or tools from platforms like Kaggle, HuggingFace, and GitHub.
Interactive UI: Provides a clean, Streamlit-based interface for users to input company names and view results.
Secure Deployment: Uses environment variables to protect sensitive API keys and a robust CI/CD pipeline.

Tech Stack

Backend: Python, Groq API, phi (multi-agent framework), DuckDuckGo Search
Frontend: Streamlit
Deployment: GitHub, Render
Utilities: python-dotenv (environment variable management)
Version Control: Git

Prerequisites

Python 3.9
Conda (for local environment management)
Groq API key (sign up at https://x.ai/api)
Git installed

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Multi-Agent-Use-Case.git
cd Multi-Agent-Use-Case


Create a Conda Environment:
conda create -n innovate-easy python=3.9
conda activate innovate-easy


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the project root:echo Groq_API_Key=your-api-key > .env

Replace your-api-key with your actual Groq API key.


Run the App Locally:
streamlit run streamlit_app.py


Open the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8501) in your browser.



Usage

Open the app (locally or at https://innovateeasy.onrender.com).
Enter a company name (e.g., "HCL Technologies") in the input field.
Click Analyze Company to generate:
Company Research: Industry, products/services, and strategic focus.
AI Use Cases: 3-5 AI-driven solutions tailored to the company.
Resources: Suggested datasets/tools for implementation.


Results are saved as markdown files (company_research.md, use_cases.md, resources.md) locally.

Deployment
The app is deployed on Render with the following configuration:

Repository: https://github.com/your-username/Multi-Agent-Use-Case
Platform: Render (free tier)
Build Command: pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command: streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port $PORT
Environment Variables:
PYTHON_VERSION=3.9
Groq_API_Key=<your-api-key>


Live URL: https://innovateeasy.onrender.com

To deploy your own instance:

Push the repository to GitHub.
Create a Render web service, connect to your repository, and configure as above.
Add the Groq_API_Key environment variable in Render.

Troubleshooting

API Errors: Ensure your Groq API key is valid and correctly set in .env or Render.
Dependency Issues: Verify requirements.txt versions match the specified ones.
Render Deployment: Check Render logs for build/start errors and adjust PYTHON_VERSION or dependencies if needed.
Local Run Fails: Confirm Python 3.9 and all dependencies are installed in your Conda environment.

Future Improvements

Add support for multiple company inputs in a single session.
Enhance UI with custom CSS and interactive charts.
Integrate additional AI models for deeper analysis.
Optimize performance for faster research and use case generation.
